### Understanding Cancer Genomics
Cancer treatment is no longer "one-size-fits-all." With **genomic sequencing**, we can uncover mutations that drive cancer, leading to **personalized therapies**.

### Why This Matters
- Not all cancers are the same.
- Targeted treatments improve outcomes.
- Knowledge empowers patients & families.

Cancer isnâ€™t just one diseaseâ€”itâ€™s a collection of many, each with its own mutations. By understanding these mutations, doctors can choose treatments that are most likely to work.
