## About OncoDecoded  

🔬 **Understanding Cancer Genomics**  

This website is dedicated to making complex genetic insights **simple and accessible**. My goal is to **bridge the gap** between scientific research and real-world impact on patients.  

Cancer treatment is no longer "one-size-fits-all." With **genomic sequencing**, we can uncover mutations that drive cancer, leading to **personalized therapies**.

📌 **Why This Matters**

Many people don’t realise how **genetic testing shapes cancer treatment**. I want to share my knowledge so more people understand **the importance of precision medicine**.  

- Not all cancers are the same.
- Targeted treatments improve outcomes.
- Knowledge empowers patients & families.

Cancer isn’t just one disease—it’s a collection of many, each with its own mutations. By understanding these mutations, doctors can choose treatments that are most likely to work.  

🚀 Explore how precision medicine is shaping the future!
